\section{What is to be Developed}  
To capture the images of vehicle number plate and process it to get the number plate information. The image processing results in extraction of vehicle number from the image which is matched with the number stored in the database to get the vehicle owner details and send appropriate message to owner via an SMS gateway.


\section{Technology Used}  

\textbf{1. Pre-processing}- The aim of pre-processing is an improvement of the image data that suppresses unwanted distortions or enhances some image features important for further processing. \\ \\
]\textbf{2. Number Plate Localisation}- Number Plate Localization is responsible for finding and isolating the plate on the picture. \\ \\
\textbf{3. Character Segmentation}- Character segmentation has long been a critical area of the OCR process. It involves analysis of a bitmap image to determine individual characters / letters / symbols. \\ \\
\textbf{4. Character Recognition}- Optical character recognition, usually abbreviated to OCR, is the mechanical or electronic conversion of scanned images of handwritten, typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text.\\ \\



\subsection{Algorithms needed}   
•	1. Plate localisation\\
•	2. Plate orientation and sizing\\
•	3. Normalization\\
•	4. Character segmentation\\
•	5. Optical character recognition(OCR)\\

\subsection{OCR using Neural Network}  
In reference to the IEEE paper 2012, a feed-forward ANN based OCR algorithm that meets the requirements of a real-time ANPR system has been proposed. The proposed algorithm can process one character image in 8.4ms with a successful recognition rate of 97.3% when using a database of 3700 character images. 
The main focus in the proposed algorithm is optimizing the number of neurons and reducing the number of multiplications which will reduce the area complexity and increase the processing speed. This is suitable for FPGA implementation as parallelism and pipelining can be exploited in the implementation of the input and output layers of the proposed neural network. The same neural network concept will be used for this project.
