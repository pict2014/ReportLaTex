Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a mass surveillance system that captures the image of vehicles and recognizes their license number. It is a recognition method in which the vehicle plate image is obtained by the digital cameras or CCTVs and the image is processed to get the number plate information. A rear image of a vehicle is captured and processed using various algorithms.\\
The processing of image results in extraction of vehicle number from the image which is then stored and matched in the database to get vehicle owner details. Using SMS Gateway, automatic messages are generated and sent to the registered user which can be used for various applications like violation of road rules, stolen and misplace vehicles, insurance and NOC validity detection, vehicle life and license validity.
